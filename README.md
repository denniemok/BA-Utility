### Introduction
This simple extension introduces several common utilities for use on BattleAsya. Since the extension was initially made for exclusive use on BattleAsya, most of the messages and parameters were hard-coded (i.e., non-configurable).<p>

BattleAsya has been using this extension on all its server instances ever since 2021. Until today, the functions it offers still provides a list of useful in-service utilities for BattleAsya's daily operations. <p>
