### Introduction
This simple extension introduces several common utilities for exclusive use on BattleAsya. Most of the messages and parameters were hard-coded (i.e., non-configurable).

BattleAsya has been using this extension on all its server instances ever since 2021. Until today, the extension still provides a list of useful in-service utilities to back up BattleAsya's daily operations.
